# README
This repo contains AWS CDK examples in python. AWS has a lot of 
documentation around the CDK but at times it can be difficult 
to follow or in some cases it's incorrect. My goal with this repo
is to provide examples from the CDK that work out of the box and can 
be used as templates for anyone who wants to use them. I will update 
this repo with more examples as time goes on and I complete more CDK
projects at work or in my personal projects. I hope someone out there 
finds this helpful. Please feel free to leave feedback if something in 
the repo in unclear.
